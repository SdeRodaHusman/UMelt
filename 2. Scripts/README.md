# Overview of scripts:

**Step 1: Preprocessing**

This script prepares the reference data (i.e., Sentinel-1 binary melt) and input features (i.e., ASCAT, SSMIS, elevation, and Sentinel-1 monthly climatology). The data are preprocessed and the 'matching overpasses' (see manuscript for more details) were selected to form the training, validation, and testing data sets.

--> The script can be used as a Python Notebook or in Google Colab (click [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1K-b04tuQiqAWzgprKUSsRVh2i2xtw70o?usp=sharing) for the Google Colab script)
