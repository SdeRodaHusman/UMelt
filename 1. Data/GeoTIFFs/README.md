**General Introduction**

The data is available for download in two formats: 
1. "UMelt_Timeseries": This format provides the data at a twice-daily resolution, allowing for detailed analysis over time.
2. "UMelt_MeltFraction": This format offers a yearly, summed product, providing a consolidated representation of the melt fraction.

Feel free to access and explore the dataset to gain valuable insights into surface melt dynamics on Antarctic ice shelves.


**Description of the data in this data set**

The data set is organized into two folders: "UMelt_Timeseries" and "UMelt_MeltFraction". 

The "UMelt_Timeseries" folder contains binary surface melt data on an Antarctic-wide scale for five melt seasons (16-17, 17-18, 18-19, 19-20, 20-21). These GeoTIFF files have a resolution of 500 meters and are available twice-daily. The data is split into nine tiles, and the location of each tile can be found in the "Overview_Tiles.jpg" file. The time information for each data point is stored in milliseconds, both in the band name and description of each band.

The "UMelt_MelFraction" folder has five GeoTIFF files corresponding to each melt season (16-17, 17-18, 18-19, 19-20, 20-21). These files provide a consolidated representation of the melt fraction.
